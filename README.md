# Glassmorphism-Weather-Webpage
A weather forcast webpage, in glassmorphism style. It is API enabled so, it shows dynamic weather of different cities.


## Setup the project:
Download or clone the whole project, and run & debug into your favourite IDE (mine is VS-CODE) but I am running these in github Codespace. 
After cloning or downloading the project, sign up on "OpenWeather API" for your API key and paste it in Key.js file.
